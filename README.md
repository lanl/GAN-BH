# Description
GAN-BH is written in python with pytorch library. It contains several different generative modeling architectures: simple GAN, conditional GAN, Wasserstein GAN, and diffusion model. It also contains physics-informed model including critic distance computation and correlation computation to all of those architecture. It has GPU capabilities to perform the work faster. 

## Dependencies

Pytorch (include torch vision), Numpy, Matplotlib


## Usage

We expect that user have appropriate training data e.g. black hole light curve in numpy array `npy`. Currently, different generative models are implemented in 1D and 2D. 

The code has two different modes

To train

`python lc_gan_1d.py --mode train --epochs 50 --data_dir <your data location>`

To generate image

`python lc_gan_1d.py --mode generate --lambda_0 25.0`
